title: How To Write a Technical Documentation for Cloud Foundry
---

This topic describes how to write technical documentation from the perspective of the author. Readers should be able to write quality documentation to contribute to Cloud Foundry after reading this piece.

## What is Technical Documentation? ##
Technical Documentation can be split into two different types: Conceptual, and Procedural.
In conceptual documentation, the author describes the issue that is being solved by the technology or system.
In procedural documentation, the author describes the specific procedure or commands to allow the technology or system to solve the issue.
The piece would be a conceptual documentation, as it doesn't provide specific steps to input into a system or technology. It merely attempts to give guidelines to best practices deemed so by the author.

## 1. Determining Purpose ##

The first step in writing technical documentation is determining the purpose of the documentation. Whether the documentation should include technological concepts, instructions, or other types of information. The purpose of the documentation will define the content and format.
Technical writing affects the subsequent behavior of readers, the quality of said technical writing affects whether behaviour is well defined.

It is important to clearly state the purpose, concepts, and issues the document intends to solve to the reader at the beginning. Technical Documentation is easier to write when purpose is defined.

## 2. Outline Before Writing ##

A well formed outline is the skeleton around which the document grows. 
There are two important rules of outlining.
	1. A sublevel topic requires at least one peer.
	2. Any outline level requires at least two sentences.

An Example of an outline following the two rules above.

## 3. Writing Steps For Technical Procedures ##

In software, there are often hard to grasp concepts. It isn't always just enter a command and the issues are solved. A good format for introducing and solidifying concepts are as follows: concept/commands - logical illustration/output - example(for conceptual documents).

## 4. Revising ##

Understanding the topic, organizing ideas and then finding the language to present the ideas clearly and accurately takes time as well as a lot of effort. Therefore, don't constrain expect to get everything right the first time. Rather, plan to write at least three versions of the piece. In the first version, just get some words in print so intentions of the documentation are clearly understood. The second version brings clarity and accuracy to the documentation. Once the facts correct, illustrations clear and organization logical, create the third version that makes the documentation engaging and special.
